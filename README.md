#  Heart Disease Prediction using Bio-inspired Algorithms

This project leverages **bio-inspired optimization algorithms**—the **Bat Algorithm (BA)** and the **Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)**—to enhance the accuracy of heart disease prediction. By applying these algorithms for **feature selection** and **parameter optimization**, the performance of machine learning classifiers such as **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Random Forest** is significantly improved.
